Banner is a relic of an aged internet.
The idea of this extension is to fix certain annoyances I've had with Banner's design
without removing its simplicity.

This extension makes these modifications

1. More responsive layout
    I.  Adds viewport meta tag to all banner sites
    II. Replaces static background image used in header with more dynamic header
