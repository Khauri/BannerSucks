# BannerSucks
Banner is a relic of an aged internet.
The idea of this extension is to fix certain annoyances I've had with Banner's design
without removing its simplicity.

This extension makes these modifications

I.      Adds viewport meta tag to all banner sites
II.     Replaces static background image used in header with more dynamic header
III.    Adds a navigation bar making it easier to get to certain items from anywhere on the site
