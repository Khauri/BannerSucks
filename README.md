# BannerSucks
[Banner](https://banweb.wm.edu) is a relic of an aged internet.
The idea of this extension is to fix some annoyances with Banner's design without removing its simplicity.

This extension makes these modifications:

1. Adds viewport meta tag to all banner sites
2. Replaces static background image used in header with more dynamic header
3. Adds a neat navigation menu making it easier to get to certain items from anywhere on the site
