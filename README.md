# BannerSucks
[Banner](https://banweb.wm.edu) is a relic of an aging internet.
The idea of this extension is to fix the biggest annoyance of Banner's design: the navigation.
It's a pain in the ass getting from one page to the next without a proper navigation menu.
I doubt Ellucian is ever going to bother to fix it, so this patchwork of an extension will have to do y'all.

This extension makes these modifications:

1. Adds viewport meta tag to all banner sites.
2. Replaces static background image used in header with more dynamic header.
3. Adds a neat navigation menu making it easier to get to certain items from anywhere on the site.

While Banner Sucks cannot help with the slow page loading times during registration, it also doesn't slow it down either.
